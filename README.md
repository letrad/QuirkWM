> A simple and easy to use Tiling Window Manager (WM).

QuirkWM aims to provide a lightweight and efficient window management experience for users who prefer a keyboard-centric environment. With its focus on simplicity and modularity, QuirkWM targets power users, developers, and those looking to streamline their workflow by minimizing mouse usage, while allowing a certain level of customization through a configuration file. Its design principles emphasize performance, ease of use, and the ability to extend functionality through integration with other command-line tools and applications.

*QuirkWM lacks thorough testing, issues may be imminent, for now, install at your own risk*

## 📦 Installation
1. Clone the repository & dependencies:
   ```shell
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/letrad/QuirkWM.git
   ```
2. Enter the directory:
   ```shell
   cd QuirkWM
   ```
3. Proceed to make:
   ```shell
   make all
   ```

### Running QuirkWM
You may now run QuirkWM from your TTY:
```shell
startx ./quirkwm
```
However, since QuirkWM is still in it's development, its recommended to run it in an isolated window with Xephyr:
```shell
Xephyr :9 -screen 1280x720 &
DISPLAY=:9 ./quirkwm
```

## 🧰 Configuration
Currently, QuirkWM can be configured through a basic config file. Any basic understanding of TOML will be sufficient.

You can learn more about configuring QuirkWM on the [Wiki]. Though, here is a quick example config:
```toml
[wm]
gap = 10

[pref]
term = "st"
```
